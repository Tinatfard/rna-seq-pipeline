# RNA-Seq Pipeline

A reproducible workflow for RNA-Seq analysis, from raw FASTQ reads to differential gene expression and pathway interpretation.

### Workflow
FASTQ → QC → Alignment → Count Matrix → DEGs → Pathway Analysis

### Tools
- fastp for quality control  
- STAR for alignment  
- featureCounts for quantification  
- DESeq2 for differential expression analysis  

Developed as part of my bioinformatics research to automate transcriptomic data analysis.
