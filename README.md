# RNA-Seq Pipeline

This workflow was developed as part of the NGnovis project — an initiative to build reproducible, automated bioinformatics pipelines for transcriptomic analysis.

### Workflow
FASTQ → QC → Alignment → Count Matrix → DEGs → Pathway Analysis

### Tools
- fastp for quality control  
- STAR for alignment  
- featureCounts for quantification  
- DESeq2 for differential expression analysis  

Developed as part of my bioinformatics research to automate transcriptomic data analysis.
